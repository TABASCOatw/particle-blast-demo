  <h3>
    Particle Smart Wallet-as-a-Service on Blast (Demo)
  </h3>
</div>

⚡️ ERC-4337 demo application showcasing utilization of Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service facilitating account abstraction on Blast Sepolia through embedded wallets and social login (creating a smart account, and pushing a user operation, one for a burn of 0.001 ETH, and one for a burn of 1 USDB).

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## 🔑 Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
